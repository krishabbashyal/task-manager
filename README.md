A CRUD functionity web application which allows for users to register for an account and create tasks or goals they intend on completeing either eventually, or by a set due date.
A live version of this application can be found on http://krishabbashyal.pythonanywhere.com/ 

Users are greeted on the home screen, from there they can create a new task. 



Tasks have 3 inital fields, the title which is required, a description and due date both of which are optional once the user submits the form to create the task it will display in the "Incomplete" section

If an update of the task is required this form however has 4 field, the same three as before but this time a competion checkbox is included as well in order to change the status of the task depending on weither it is completed or not.

Depending on the status, the task will display in the respective category. Unchecked will be in "Incomple" but checked boxes will show in the "Complete" tab.
